    <h1>About the Vocal for Local Movement</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Vocal for Local</strong> is more than just a slogan — it’s a movement to empower Indian businesses, entrepreneurs, and artisans. It encourages every citizen to prefer products made in India, fostering economic growth and national pride.
